# RunExecutableStep
A Simio user-defined Step to run and executable with arguments

This includes both Executables and Source folders, as well as test programs and Documentation.

For a quick start, 
* create a Test\TestRunExecutable folder on your c: drive 
* move the exe files from Executables to your test folder
* move the dll file in Executables to your Documents\SimioUserExtensions folder
* and then run the test Simio project (.SPFX) in the Models folder.

The test Simio Project has three instances of this RunExecutable Step. One of them runs a Python Script and the other two run a .NET executable.
